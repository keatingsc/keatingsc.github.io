      <description>A Technical Writer (TW) is someone who creates, structures, and publishes relevant information for a target audience in a timely manner. A TW generally works in a specific industry sector, creating modular content to describe complex products or processes. Their role is to bridge the information gap between product developer and end-user, juggling a diverse set of tools for communication, project management, content design, and publishing.
Creating content and publishing it is a very rewarding part of the writing process.</description>

      <description>Hello there. Thank you for getting in touch. I share this website with prospective employers who, during the interview process, have asked to see some sample work.
These sample pieces of writing are deliberately generic; they do not reference any proprietary technology or software, which would be subject to a NDA I have signed in the past.</description>

      <description>It is important to structure your content in an easy-to-navigate manner.
Use a navigation structure To develop a clear visual hierarchy on your documentation website:
 Organise menus by topic Group similar types of content under the same menu Use a maximum of two levels of submenu  Make the documentation searchable Documentation must be searchable and information easy to find. Some recommendations include:
 Create short, unique, and accurate page titles.</description>

      <description>I love to write and I feel my writing helps people understand technology and apply this knowledge to effectively use an application or system. I have 20 years&#39; experience working in the IT sector. I include here some generic examples of my writing, to demonstrate what technical writing means to me and to describe my experience of the docs-as-code workflow.

      <description>A docs-as-code workflow means applying software development processes and tools to technical documentation. As a Technical Writer (TW), you write content in plain text with simple markdown using a code editor, rather than using a full markup language like XML and a content management system. You publish docs using a static site generator and build scripts, rather than a complex publishing system. TWs work with docs as developers work with code, relying on a source control system to track changes in the documentation suite.</description>
