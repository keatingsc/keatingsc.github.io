      <description>A Technical Writer (TW) is someone who creates, structures, and publishes relevant information for a target audience in a timely manner. A TW generally works in a specific industry sector, creating modular content to describe complex products or processes. Their role is to bridge the information gap between product developer and end-user, juggling a diverse set of tools for communication, project management, content design, and publishing.
Creating content and publishing it is a very rewarding part of the writing process.</description>

      <description>It is important to structure your content in an easy-to-navigate manner.
Use a navigation structure To develop a clear visual hierarchy on your documentation website:
 Organise menus by topic Group similar types of content under the same menu Use a maximum of two levels of submenu  Make the documentation searchable Documentation must be searchable and information easy to find. Some recommendations include:

      <title>What is docs-as-code?</title>

      <description>A docs-as-code workflow means applying software development processes and tools to technical documentation. As a Technical Writer (TW), you write content in plain text with simple markdown using a code editor, rather than using a full markup language like XML and a content management system. You publish docs using a static site generator and build scripts, rather than a complex publishing system. TWs work with docs as developers work with code, relying on a source control system to track changes in the documentation suite.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the Web. This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme. Compare the source file, in &lt;strong&gt;markdown-syntax.md&lt;/strong&gt; in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/keatingsc/technical-writing/tree/main/content/posts&#34;&gt;Git repository&lt;/a&gt;, to see how the Markdown content is rendered in this HTML output. For more details, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/&#34;&gt;GitHub Flavored Markdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
