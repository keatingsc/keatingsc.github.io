      <description>A Technical Writer (TW) is someone who creates, structures, and publishes relevant information for a target audience in a timely manner. A TW generally works in a specific industry sector, creating modular content to describe complex products or processes. Their role is to bridge the information gap between product developer and end-user, juggling a diverse set of tools for communication, project management, content design, and publishing.
Creating content and publishing it is a very rewarding part of the writing process.</description>

      <description>It is important to structure your content in an easy-to-navigate manner.

      <title>What is docs-as-code?</title>

      <description>A docs-as-code workflow means applying software development processes and tools to technical documentation. As a Technical Writer (TW), you write content in plain text with simple markdown using a code editor, rather than using a full markup language like XML and a content management system. You publish docs using a static site generator and build scripts, rather than a complex publishing system. TWs work with docs as developers work with code, relying on a source control system to track changes in the documentation suite.</description>
